# The Odin Project

This repository contains all assignmnets, exercises, and projects completed through The Odin Project&trade;

The Odin Project&trade; is a FullStack web developer curriculm designed by people who have worked in the software industry as web developers. It operates as a guide for the necessary attitude & skill-set required of a FullStack Web developer. It was created because the developers wished they had something equivalent when they started learning web-development. 

I'm going through with learning this skill for three reasons:
1. It is useful to know how to work with computers beyond using applications designed by others
2. I want to use the skills garned to make myself employable
3. I love to create things, even when I often feel like it's pointless. Creation is an expression of divinity and I the process of creating things you approach divinity.
