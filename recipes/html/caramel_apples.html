  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    From carnivals to fairs, the candy-covered apple is one of those quintessential festival treats and, along with
    candy corn, a Halloween staple.
    You can easily make your own caramel from scratch, using just a handful of ingredients: Take a crisp apple and swirl
    it with a coating of rich caramel
  </p>
  <h2>Ingridients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup of sugar</li>
    <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
    <li>4 large apples</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of salted butter</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Core the apples and cut them into wedges</li>
    <li>In a saucepan, combine the sugar and water over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Continue to
      cook, wihtout stirring, until the mixture turns a golden caramel color</li>
    <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and carefully stir in the heavy cream, salted butter, and sea salt. The
      mixture will bubble up, so be cautious</li>
    <li>Return the saucepan to low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the caramel is smooth and all the
      ingredients are fully incorporated</li>
    <li>Allow the caramel to cool slightly, then drizzle it over the apple wedges or serve it as a dipping sauce</li>
  </ol>
