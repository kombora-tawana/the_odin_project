  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Skyr (pronounced “skeer”) is an Icelandic dairy product with a texture and taste like very thick yogurt. It has a
    rich and creamy texture similar to Greek yogurt. Many people outside of Iceland refer to it as Icelandic Greek
    yogurt, but it is a type of cheese rather than yogurt, somewhat like ricotta or mascarpone.

  </p>
  <p>
    Like Greek yogurt, skyr has a slightly sour taste. However, it's much milder in flavor, so most people find it more
    enjoyable to eat.
