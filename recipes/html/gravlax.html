  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    The word's origins date back to a time when Swedish fisherman would salt their catch and bury it near the shore to
    ferment it. It combines the terms "grav," which refers to a grave or hole in the ground in Scandinavian languages,
    and "lax," meaning salmon (via <a href="https://www.foodrepublic.com/recipes/easy-gravlax-recipe/">Food
      Republic</a>).

  <h2>Ingridients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>500g fresh salmon skillet: skin on</li>
    <li>2 tbsp crushed black pepper</li>
    <li>1 large bunch of fresh dill</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, combine the salt, sugar, and crushed black pepper.</li>
    <li>Spread half of the dill on a large piece of plastic wrap. Place the salmon fillet skin-side down on the dill,
      and then cover the fillet with the salt mixture.</li>
    <li>Top the salmon with the remaining dill and wrap the plastic wrap tightly around the fillet.</li>
    <li>Place the wrapped salmon on a tray or dish and refrigerate for 48-72 hours, turning the fillet every 12 hours to
      ensure even curing.</li>
    <li>After curing, remove the salmon from the plastic wrap and gently scrape off the dill and curing mixture.</li>
    <li>Thinly slice the gravlax and serve on rye bread or crispbread with dollop of mustard sauce.</li>
  </ol>
