  <h1>Mead a.k.a Honey-Wine</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Vikings drank mead at seasonal feasts and other ceremonies that commemorated life’s milestones. It was about more
    than just enjoying a tipple—it was a ritual. The king would be served first, followed by others according to their
    social rank.</p>
  <p>
    The Norse sometimes have a raucous reputation, but if they did get drunk quickly on mead, that might
    have been partly due to the serving vessel: a drinking horn which could not easily be put down, therefore
    encouraging faster consumption.
